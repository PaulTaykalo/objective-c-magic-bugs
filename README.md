# NSLog Magic  
## Intro:  
Original project had around 40K lines of code, and it was really painful to find the reason of this bug  .

## Description:  
You have very small project, with not so much amount lines of code, and it crashes "sometimes". 
Some strange things of this project:  
* It crashes only when it's being run on iOS Simulator  
* It crashes only when it's being run on iOS Simulator with 5.1 version  
* It won't crash if NSLog call will be commented out  
  
## Goals  
* 0. Code should not crash (Easiest one, just uncommend NSLog call).  
* 1. Find "problematic" method(s)  
* 2. Does uncommenting NSLog REALLY fix main problem?  
* 4. What is the reason of crash?  
* 8. Find why it isn't crashing on the Device  
* 16. Why NSLog is able to fix the problem?  
* 32. Reproduce this bug on other Base SDK's / iOS Simulator versions

##Outro:  
Goals from 0 to 1 are pretty easy to achive  
Starting from goal 4, you need some skills that may not be related to Objective-C itself.   

Are you experienced enough to achieve all goals, or at least up to goal#16 ? :)
